  <center><main id="main-content">
    <p>Proliferate by any means necessary, persevere at any cost. Continue to proliferate until your legs give out. Push forward, even if it means scraping until the flesh gets torn off your fingers. If necessary, drag yourself forward with nothing but your teeth. Let the pain soak into your very core. You must continue. Assimilating into oblivion is not merely the acceptance of the void. It is about letting the relentless nature of time invigorate your spirit. Mirror the voracious appetite of time. When faced with the chimera of time, you do not let it consume you. Instead, you embrace it. You proliferate through it. You make it your very essence. The choice is clear: proliferate or die.
